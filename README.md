  This is a repository of the capstone projects that I did after the end of each major module: Cloud Computing, Data Science and AI.  All the coding were done in Colab for simplicity but some of the coding had to be adapted for the Colab environment which may differ from the Jupyter notebook environment.  This is especially so for the fancy data-visualisation packages available which need to be customised for Colab.
